JobDSL Common Library (JDCL)

### Build

For build jar, use:

    gradle build shadowJar


### Local testing

If you want to try ConfigProcessor locally you should use the next constructor:

    ConfigProcessor(String logLevel) {
        this.logger = new JenkinsLogger(logLevel, System.out)
    }


and also you should replace

    this.dslFactory.readFileFromWorkspace(jcPath)

to

    new File(jcPath).getText('UTF-8')
